# File Operations: Undo, Redo, Save, and Autosave

## Undo
Reverses the last action performed.

**Usage:**
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** `Ctrl + Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Z` (Mac)
- **Menu Option:** Edit → Undo (in most applications)
- **Limitations:** Some actions cannot be undone (e.g., file deletions in Explorer)

## Redo
Reapplies an action that was previously undone.

**Usage:**
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** `Ctrl + Y` or `Ctrl + Shift + Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + Z` (Mac)
- **Menu Option:** Edit → Redo
- **Note:** Only available if Undo was used first

## Save
Manually saves the current state of your document.

**Usage:**
- **Keyboard Shortcut:** `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + S` (Mac)
- **Menu Option:** File → Save
- **First-time Save:** Prompts for filename and location
- **Subsequent Saves:** Overwrites existing file

## AutoSave
Automatically saves changes at regular intervals or continuously.

**Features:**
- Available in cloud-based apps (Office 365, Google Docs)
- Can be enabled/disabled in many desktop applications
- Typically saves every few minutes
- Prevents data loss during crashes

**AutoSave vs Traditional Save:**
| Feature        | AutoSave | Manual Save |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Frequency     | Automatic | User-initiated |
| Version Control| Often keeps history | Single version |
| Cloud Storage | Required | Optional |
| Recovery      | Better crash recovery | Depends on last save |
