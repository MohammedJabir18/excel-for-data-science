## 🧩 Problem Statement:

You are given an Excel workbook with a sheet called **"SalesData"**. Perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Entry & Formatting**
   - Enter the following data into the sheet starting from cell **A1**:

| Product | January | February | March |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Apple   | 120     | 130      | 110   |
| Banana  | 90      | 95       | 100   |
| Cherry  | 150     | 160      | 155   |

   - Format the header row (**A1:D1**) to **bold** and **center** the text.

2. **Autofill and Flash Fill**
   - In column E, under the header "Quarter 1 Total", calculate the sum of January, February, and March sales using a formula. Use **Autofill** to apply the formula to all rows.
   - In column F, create a new column titled "Product & Sales" where you combine the product name and January sales (e.g., "Apple - 120"). Use **Flash Fill** after typing the first example.

3. **Copy-Paste Techniques**
   - Copy the table (A1:D4) and **Transpose** it into a new sheet named **"TransposedData"** starting from cell A1.
   - In the **SalesData** sheet, copy only the **formats** of the table into the range A6:D9 using **Paste Special**.

4. **Undo, Redo, Save, Autosave**
   - Make a formatting change (like changing font color) and then **Undo** it.
   - Redo the undone change using **Redo**.
   - Save your workbook manually and make sure **Autosave** is turned ON (if available).
